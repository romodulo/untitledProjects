I am making this file
to store my thoughts and 
ideas for tutorials I hope to
make in the future.

For Learning How to Program:
these are my notes::
;
"Remember what certain words mean in software-programming but you don't have to
memorize them by heart at the beginning of your learning."
A good set of vocabulary/ terms is essential at the beginning of your learning; 
you may look at the meaning of the words pass, arguments, among various other
terms. (e.g. other terms include: ) As an experienced programmer I understand
the meaning of terms such as modules, functions, classes, among many others 
which I won't get into right now because these terms begin to enter two-word
territory (e.g. two-words as a term)
