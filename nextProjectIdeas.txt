Under Example-Reference is 2-lines I want to replicate. 
I want to possibly create an application that will take a json file
of all my tabs open and create a list of tabs I hope to close. 
Q's:
I wonder if there is a quick, easy way to get a json file
of all recently closed tabs
From this [date-range][time-range] until another [date-range][time-range],
Cross-Reference the recently closed tabs within an
estimated-approximate timeframe with tabs from the file
with all the tabs opened [mostly generated from my firebrowser-tab-extension
which handles my tabs]
